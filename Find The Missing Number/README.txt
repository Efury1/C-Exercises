### Problem: **Find the Missing Number**

You are given an array of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n+1`. The array contains all the numbers in this range except one, which is missing. You need to find the missing number.

#### Example:

**Input:**  
`[1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]`

**Output:**  
`5`

#### Constraints:
- The array length will be `n`.
- The array will contain distinct integers.

### How to approach:
- Try to come up with an efficient solution. Consider time complexity and space complexity.
- Think about leveraging mathematical formulas, like the sum of an arithmetic series, or bitwise operations.
